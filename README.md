# Address Book Application

The Address Book Application is a command-line program that allows you to manage a personal address book. It provides functionality to add, remove, update, search, and list contacts. The application stores the contacts in a file for persistent storage.

## Features

- Add a new contact with a name, email, and phone number
- Remove an existing contact by name
- Update the details of an existing contact
- Search for contacts by name, email, or phone number
- List all contacts in the address book
- Save and load contacts from a file for data persistence

## Requirements

To run the Address Book Application, you need the following:

- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)
- Standard Library headers: iostream, fstream, string
- Regular Expression Library (for email and phone number validation)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu of options to perform various operations on your address book. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, remove, update, search, or list contacts.

## File Structure

- `addressbook.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the AddressBook class.
- `addressbook.h`: Contains the declaration of the AddressBook class and the Contact structure.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main entry point of the application.
- `README.md`: The documentation file you're currently reading.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements to the Address Book Application:

- Implement additional search criteria, such as searching by address or organization.
- Add sorting and filtering options for the contact list.
- Improve error handling and input validation.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Allow import and export of contact data in different formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
